                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus#cite_note-2">[nb
                    1]</a>
            </sup> is a genus of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaur. The <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species">species</a> Tyrannosaurus rex (rex
            meaning
            "king" in
            Latin), often called T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the most well-represented of these
            large
            theropods.
            Tyrannosaurus lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island
            continent known
            as
            Laramidia. Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a
            variety of
            rock
            formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the upper Cretaceous period, 68 to 66 million years
            ago. It
            was
            the
            last
            known member of the tyrannosaurids, and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the
            Cretaceous–Paleogene
            extinction event.
        </p>
        <p>Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a
            long,
            heavy
            tail.
            Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, Tyrannosaurus forelimbs were short but unusually
            powerful for
            their
            size and had two clawed digits. The most complete specimen measures up to 12.3 meters (40 feet) in
            length
            though
            T.
            rex could grow to lengths of over 12.3 m (40 ft), up to 3.96 m (13 ft) tall at the hips, and
            according to
            most
            modern estimates 8.4 metric tons (9.3 short tons) to 14 metric tons (15.4 short tons) in weight.
            Although
            other
            theropods rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus rex in size, it is still among the largest known land
            predators
            and
            is
            estimated to have exerted the 2nd strongest bite force among all terrestrial animals (the greatest
            being
            Deinosuchus). By far the largest carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex was most likely an
            apex
            predator,
            preying upon hadrosaurs, Juvenile armored herbivores like ceratopsians and ankylosaurs, and possibly
            sauropods.
            Some
            experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger. The question of whether Tyrannosaurus
            was an
            apex
            predator or a pure scavenger was among the longest debates in paleontology. Most paleontologists
            today
            accept
            that
            Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger.

        <h2>History of research</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Earliest finds</h3>
            <p>Teeth from what is now documented as a Tyrannosaurus rex were found in 1874 by Arthur Lakes near
                Golden,
                Colorado. In
                the early 1890s, John Bell Hatcher collected postcranial elements in eastern Wyoming. The
                fossils were
                believed
                to
                be from the large species Ornithomimus grandis (now Deinodon) but are now considered T. rex
                remains.[2]

                In 1892, Edward Drinker Cope found two vertebral fragments of a large dinosaur. Cope believed
                the
                fragments
                belonged
                to an "agathaumid" (ceratopsid) dinosaur, and named them Manospondylus gigas, meaning "giant
                porous
                vertebra",
                in
                reference to the numerous openings for blood vessels he found in the bone.[2] The M. gigas
                remains were,
                in
                1907,
                identified by Hatcher as those of a theropod rather than a ceratopsid.[3]

                Henry Fairfield Osborn recognized the similarity between Manospondylus gigas and T. rex as early
                as
                1917, by
                which
                time the second vertebra had been lost. Owing to the fragmentary nature of the Manospondylus
                vertebrae,
                Osborn
                did
                not synonymize the two genera, instead considering the older genus indeterminate.[4] In June
                2000, the
                Black
                Hills
                Institute found around 10% of a Tyrannosaurus skeleton (BHI 6248) at a site that might have been
                the
                original M.
                gigas locality.[5]</p>

        <h3>Skeleton discovery and naming</h3>
        <p>Barnum Brown, assistant curator of the American Museum of Natural History, found the first partial
            skeleton
            of T.
            rex
            in eastern Wyoming in 1900. Brown found another partial skeleton in the Hell Creek Formation in
            Montana in
            1902,
            comprising approximately 34 fossilized bones.[6] Writing at the time Brown said "Quarry No. 1
            contains the
            femur,
            pubes, humerus, three vertebrae and two undetermined bones of a large Carnivorous Dinosaur not
            described by
            Marsh.... I have never seen anything like it from the Cretaceous".[7] Henry Fairfield Osborn,
            president of
            the
            American Museum of Natural History, named the second skeleton T. rex in 1905. The generic name is
            derived
            from
            the
            Greek words τύραννος (tyrannos, meaning "tyrant") and σαῦρος (sauros, meaning "lizard"). Osborn used
            the
            Latin
            word
            rex, meaning "king", for the specific name. The full binomial therefore translates to "tyrant lizard
            the
            king"
            or
            "King Tyrant Lizard", emphasizing the animal's size and perceived dominance over other species of
            the
            time.[6]
